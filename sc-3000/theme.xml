				<text>SC-3000 was a home computer manufactured by Sega equivalent to the SG-1000 video game. It was sold for ¥ 29,800 in 1983 and advertised as a starter computer. Thanks to compatibility with games developed for SG-1000 and due to the ability to use typical computer applications, it sold more units than SG-1000. In addition, their users could create their own software and games on their own machine.

The SC-3000H, originally sold for 33,800 yen, was an improved version of the original system, with more RAM and an improved keyboard (the original version was equipped with a membrane keyboard). Accessories available for the computer included a speech synthesis unit, an optical pen, and an extension called SF-7000 that added 64KB of RAM, 8KB of ROM, a floppy disk drive, a Centronics parallel port, and a serial port.
